# setupVaspcalc_0 contains all scripts useful to set vasp calculations

# check_sym , FixAtoms_slab.py,FixAtoms_struct, getKsp,makeslab,makesupercell,vasp2cml, vasp2pbd. Install ase and pymatgen on
# your python.

So far I have been using the two different materials silicon and silica therefore some script might have written taking into
account this fact. If you need to use FixAtoms_slab and FixAtoms_struct for example changes some lines based on your needs.

What are useful for the script? What's the idea behind them?

# check_sym     -> Detect space group of a certain structure. Usage: python3 check_sym CONTCAR (or POSCAR)

# FixAtoms_slab.py ->
