# setupVaspcalc_0 contains all scripts useful to set vasp calculations

# check_sym , FixAtoms_slab.py,FixAtoms_struct, getKsp,makeslab,makesupercell,vasp2cml, vasp2pbd. Install ase and pymatgen on
# your python.

So far I have been using the two different materials silicon and silica therefore some script might have written taking into
account this fact. If you need to use FixAtoms_slab and FixAtoms_struct for other structures change some lines based on your needs.
What are useful for the script? What's the idea behind them?

# check_sym     -> Detect space group of a certain structure. Usage: python3 check_sym CONTCAR (or POSCAR)

# FixAtoms_slab.py ->  Freeze atoms for slab relaxation
e.g. python3 FixAtoms_slab vaspfile 6 -> It's going to fix all  non-hydrogen atoms below 6 Angstrom
6 is the upper_limit_z. It is expressed in cartesian coordinates and represents the maximum limit where the method FixAtoms is 
going to fix non-H atoms i.e. above upper_limit_z atoms will be free to relax. In addition also H atoms at the bottom will be free to relax.  

# FixAtoms_struct ->  Freeze atoms for slab relaxation. ( FixAtoms was created for freezing atoms in chemisorbed  and
physisorbed species ). 
e.g python3 FixAtoms_struct vaspfile 6. ->  It's going to fix all atoms below 6 Angstrom
6 is the upper limit. It is expressed in cartesian coordinates and the maximum limit where the method FixAtoms is 
# going to fix atoms i.e. above upper_limit_z atoms will be free to relax. The only difference between FixAtoms_slab is that 
# H atoms at the bottom are kept fix here.
